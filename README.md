in this project, I'm trying to challenge my adaptability and resilience by facing new frameworks and libraries for the first time and depending on the authorized documentation, Thus you will notice some bad practices in some components It's intentional because I'm trying to simulate the real world project process approach then I'll enhance the components and the code on the final stage.
